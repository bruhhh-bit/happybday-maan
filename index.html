	<h1>Happy Birthday, Maan!</h1>
	<p>Wishing you a day filled with joy, laughter, and all your favorite things.</p>
	You are a unique individual with a heart of gold. You always put others before yourself and your kindness and compassion are truly inspiring. You have an infectious smile and an unwavering positivity that brightens up any room you walk into. Your upbeat and joyful spirit is contagious, and nagpapasalamat ren ako kase lagi kang andyan sa mga taong nangangailangan ng kausap at kabonding, sa mga taong na d-down sa kanilang problems.
 You are always there for me, providing a listening ear and a supportive shoulder to lean on. You have been a constant source of encouragement and motivation, pushing me to be the best version of myself katulad ng dati elementary moments HAHAHAHHA. Your friendship is a true gift, and I cherish every moment we spend together.

As you celebrate another year of life, I hope you know just how loved and appreciated you are. May this year be filled with all the things that make you happy - good health, success, and countless moments of joy and laughter. You deserve nothing but the best, and I hope that this birthday is just the beginning of a year filled with incredible opportunities and experiences.

Once again, happy birthday, maaand! May this special day bring you all the happiness and love that you deserve.
